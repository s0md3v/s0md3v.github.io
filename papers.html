        <p>
            Most WAFs and XSS filters rely on regex to catch malicious input. Instead of blindly firing payloads until
            something sticks, this paper proposes a methodology to reverse-engineer those regex rules by probing. Once
            you know the rules (e.g., "it blocks <code>&lt;script</code> but allows <code>&lt;object</code>"), you can
            craft a payload that specifically fits the gaps. It covers bypassing filters in HTML contexts, event
            handlers, and JavaScript execution sinks.

        <p>
            Mathematical entropy (Shannon entropy) is often used to detect random gibberish, but it sucks at successfuly
            identifying things like <code>frontendElementAsyncInit</code> (low entropy, but meaningful) vs
            <code>9033e0e305f2</code> (limited char set, but random).

            This paper introduces an approach based on <strong>pronounceability</strong>. By analyzing bigrams (pairs of
            characters), we can determine if a string "sounds" like a word in a given language. If it's pronounceable,
            it's likely not random junk. This is much faster than dictionary lookups and more accurate than standard
            entropy checks for detecting machine-generated strings.
